# lmm_eigen
Implements several fast linear mixed model approaches for correlated samples / related individuals.
The methods are based on the Generalised Least Squares approach.

# gen_sim
We also provide functions to simulate Genotype and Phenotype data subject to population structure with k subpopulations, ancestry-related random effects, and separate genetic effect and ancestry effect SNPs. The genotype differences in allele frequencies can be specificied.

# gwas_lmm_demo
We demo the above functions on a ilustrative GWAS example correcting population structure using different appraoches and noting the impact of the different appraoches on the effect size estimates. 

# LMM Lite
We also implement the method described in the following paper:
